# Physics Course

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

I decided the best way to be prepared for physics courses is to make a list of everything in the class, then use that list as a checklist for everything I need to study. In the process of doing this, I am also creating a course that anyone else can use, and that I can use for reference later on.

### Installation

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

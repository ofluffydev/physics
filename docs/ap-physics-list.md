List specifically for AP Physics students. (Please still read the [introduction](/docs/intro) for this course.)

## AP Physics 1

Based on [College Board's AP Physics 1](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-physics-1-algebra-based)

Note that the website says "May include," so there may be missing or extra topics here.

Also, since this is "Algebra-Based," I added an entire math section for this course. :p

### Unit 1: Kinematics

10%â€“15% of multiple-choice exam score

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering its causes. This unit covers the following topics:

-   Scalars and vectors in one dimension (Why not 2 and 3 dimensions? ðŸ˜ž)
    -   Scalars and Vectors have their own category [here](/docs/category/scalars-and-vectors) and a short section [here](https://physics.kadenfrisk.com/docs/classical-mechanics/kinematics/vectors-and-scalars) which is more focused on vectors and scalars in kinematics.
    -   One-dimensional motion is covered [here](/docs/classical-mechanics/kinematics/one-dimensional-motion).
-   Displacement, velocity, and acceleration
    -   Has its own page [here](/docs/classical-mechanics/kinematics/displacement-velocity-and-acceleration).
-   Representing motion

    -   This section focuses on graphing and showing motion, which can be done with the following:

        -   Position-time graphs
        -   Velocity-time graphs
        -   Mathematical equations
        -   Vector notation

        These are covered [here](/docs/classical-mechanics/kinematics/kinematics-intro) but will be getting their own pages soon.

-   Reference frames and relative motion
-   Vectors and motion in two dimensions

### Unit 2: Force and Translational Dynamics

18%â€“23% of multiple-choice exam score

Force and Translational Dynamics is the study of the causes of motion. This unit covers the following topics:

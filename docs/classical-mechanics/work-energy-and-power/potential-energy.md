# Potential Energy

## Introduction

Potential energy is a fundamental concept in physics that represents the stored energy of an object due to its position or configuration. This lesson focuses on two common types of potential energy: gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy.

## General Definition

Potential energy is the energy possessed by an object because of its position relative to other objects or its internal configuration.

## 1. Gravitational Potential Energy

### Definition

Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a gravitational field.

### Mathematical Representation

For objects near Earth's surface:

PE_g = mgh

Where:

-   PE_g is gravitational potential energy (measured in joules, J)
-   m is the mass of the object (measured in kilograms, kg)
-   g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s² on Earth)
-   h is the height above a reference point (measured in meters, m)

### Key Properties

1. **Reference Point**: The choice of reference point (h = 0) is arbitrary but must be consistent within a problem.
2. **Proportional to Height**: Increases linearly with height.
3. **Negative Values**: Can be negative depending on the chosen reference point.

### Applications

1. Hydroelectric power generation
2. Pendulum motion
3. Roller coaster design
4. Satellite orbits
5. Water tower pressure systems

## 2. Elastic Potential Energy

### Definition

Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an object when it is stretched or compressed from its equilibrium position.

### Mathematical Representation

For an ideal spring:

PE_e = 1/2 kx²

Where:

-   PE_e is elastic potential energy (measured in joules, J)
-   k is the spring constant (measured in newtons per meter, N/m)
-   x is the displacement from the equilibrium position (measured in meters, m)

### Key Properties

1. **Quadratic Relationship**: Increases with the square of displacement.
2. **Always Positive**: For an ideal spring, elastic potential energy is always positive or zero.
3. **Conservative Force**: The stored energy can be fully recovered in an ideal system.

### Applications

1. Vehicle suspension systems
2. Bungee jumping
3. Archery (bow and arrow)
4. Mechanical watches
5. Seismometers

## Comparison of Gravitational and Elastic Potential Energy

1. **Dependence**: Gravitational PE depends on height, while elastic PE depends on displacement.
2. **Relationship**: Gravitational PE is linear with height, elastic PE is quadratic with displacement.
3. **Reference**: Gravitational PE requires a reference point; elastic PE uses the equilibrium position as reference.
4. **Sign**: Gravitational PE can be positive or negative; elastic PE is always non-negative for ideal springs.

## Conservation of Energy

Both forms of potential energy play crucial roles in the principle of conservation of energy. As an object falls, its gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy. Similarly, as a spring is released, its elastic potential energy converts to kinetic energy.

## Example Problems

### Problem 1: Gravitational Potential Energy

A 2 kg book is lifted from ground level to a shelf 1.5 m high. Calculate the increase in its gravitational potential energy.

TODO: Add solution.

### Problem 2: Elastic Potential Energy

A spring with a spring constant of 200 N/m is compressed by 0.1 m. What is the elastic potential energy stored in the spring?

TODO: Add solution.

### Problem 3: Conservation of Energy (Gravitational)

A 500 g ball is dropped from a height of 10 m. Ignoring air resistance, what is its velocity just before it hits the ground?

TODO: Add solution.

### Problem 4: Conservation of Energy (Elastic)

A 0.5 kg mass is attached to a vertical spring with k = 100 N/m. The mass is pulled down 0.2 m and released. What is its maximum velocity?

TODO: Add solution.

## Conclusion

Potential energy, both gravitational and elastic, is a crucial concept in understanding energy storage and transfer in physical systems. These forms of potential energy provide insights into various natural phenomena and have numerous practical applications in engineering and technology.

Understanding potential energy is essential for analyzing complex systems where energy transformations occur. It forms the basis for solving problems in mechanics, structural engineering, and many other fields. By mastering the concepts of gravitational and elastic potential energy, students and professionals can better comprehend energy conservation, design more efficient systems, and solve complex problems involving energy storage and transfer.

# Vectors and Scalars in Kinematics

## Introduction

In kinematics, the study of motion, we encounter two fundamental types of quantities: scalars and vectors. Understanding the difference between these and how to work with them is crucial for describing and analyzing motion accurately.

These will also be in the [dictionary](/docs/dictionary) for quick reference.

## Scalars

### Definition
A scalar is a quantity that has magnitude (size) only. It can be completely described by a single number and its unit.

### Examples in Kinematics
1. Distance: The total length of the path traveled (e.g., 100 meters)
2. Speed: The rate of change of distance (e.g., 20 m/s)
3. Time: Duration of motion (e.g., 5 seconds)
4. Mass: Amount of matter in an object (e.g., 2 kg)

### Properties
- Can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided using ordinary arithmetic
- Do not have direction

## Vectors

### Definition
A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction. It is typically represented by an arrow, where the length of the arrow indicates the magnitude, and the orientation shows the direction.

### Examples in Kinematics
1. Displacement: Change in position (e.g., 50 m east)
2. Velocity: Rate of change of displacement (e.g., 20 m/s north)
3. Acceleration: Rate of change of velocity (e.g., 5 m/s² downward)
4. Force: Push or pull on an object (e.g., 10 N upward)

### Properties
- Have both magnitude and direction
- Can be added or subtracted using graphical or analytical methods
- Can be multiplied by scalars
- Can be multiplied with other vectors (dot product and cross product)

### Vector Notation
Vectors are often denoted in different ways:
- Bold letters: **v**, **a**, **F**
- Letters with arrows above them: v→, a→, F→
- For unit vectors (vectors with a magnitude of 1): î, ĵ, k̂ (for x, y, and z directions respectively)

## Vector Operations

### 1. Addition and Subtraction
Vectors can be added or subtracted graphically (tip-to-tail method) or analytically (component-wise).

Example: Adding displacement vectors
A→ = 3î + 4ĵ
B→ = 2î - 1ĵ
A→ + B→ = (3 + 2)î + (4 - 1)ĵ = 5î + 3ĵ

### 2. Multiplication by a Scalar
When a vector is multiplied by a scalar, its magnitude changes, but its direction remains the same (unless the scalar is negative, which reverses the direction).

Example: Doubling a velocity vector
v→ = 3î - 2ĵ
2v→ = 6î - 4ĵ

### 3. Dot Product
The dot product of two vectors results in a scalar.
A · B = |A||B|cosθ, where θ is the angle between the vectors.

Example: Work done by a force
W = F · d = |F||d|cosθ

### 4. Cross Product
The cross product of two vectors results in a vector perpendicular to both.
A × B = |A||B|sinθ n̂, where n̂ is the unit vector perpendicular to both A and B.

Example: Torque
τ = r × F

## Importance in Kinematics

1. Describing Motion: Vectors allow us to describe motion in two and three dimensions accurately.

2. Relative Motion: Vector addition enables us to calculate relative velocities and positions.

3. Projectile Motion: Separating velocity into horizontal and vertical components allows us to analyze projectile motion.

4. Circular Motion: Vectors are crucial for describing the changing direction of velocity in circular motion.

## Problem-Solving Approach

When solving kinematics problems involving vectors:

1. Clearly define your coordinate system.
2. Break vectors into components if needed.
3. Treat each component independently in calculations.
4. Combine components to get the final vector result.
5. Pay attention to signs to ensure correct direction.

## Example Problem

A car travels 30 m east, then 40 m north, and finally 20 m east. Calculate its total displacement.

Solution:

TODO: Add solution

## Conclusion

Understanding vectors and scalars is fundamental to kinematics. Vectors allow us to describe motion completely, including both the magnitude and direction of quantities like displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Scalar quantities, while simpler, are equally important for concepts like speed and distance. Mastering these concepts and the operations involving them is crucial for solving complex motion problems in physics.

## Practice Problems

1. A hiker walks 3 km east, then 4 km north. What is their total displacement?

2. An object has an initial velocity of 5 m/s east and accelerates at 2 m/s² north for 3 seconds. What is its final velocity?

3. Two forces act on a particle: F1 = 3î + 4ĵ N and F2 = -2î + 5ĵ N. Calculate the magnitude and direction of the resultant force.
